Below are the top ranked states that are models of high-quality care. Using the same score as I used to rank hospitals (a combination of Normalized Clinical Care metrics), I grouped by state and found the average score. The list may be biased by small states that may have fewer hospitals to contribute to their average. Because of that I also included the count of hospitals in the state. Regardless I believe it is a good representation of states with high-quality care. States such as California and Florida have a large number of hospitals but still compete nationally in terms of average hospital score.
