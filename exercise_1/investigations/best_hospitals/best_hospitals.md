Below are my results for which hospitals are models of high-quality care. To compute the Clinical Care Score I took a combination of the Normalized_Clinical_Care__Process_Domain_Score (0.25%) and the Unweighted_Normalized_Clinical_Care__Outcomes_Domain_Score (0.75%). Both values were taken from the TPS table. I believe these two metrics combine to provide a broad understanding of the hospital's care. A few things to note: first, some hospitals did not have ratings for one or both of these metrics. Those hospitals were ignored. Second, while these results are limited 10, there were a number of hospitals that tied for the number nine spot.
